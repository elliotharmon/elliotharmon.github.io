<p><a href="http://10.creativecommons.org">Creative Commons is turning 10 this year!</a> We'll be hosting parties around the world and sharing party favors online for a ten-day celebration, December 7 to 16.</p>

<p>To see a listing of the parties we have planned, visit the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC10">#cc10 wiki page</a>. There are more in the works, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>Do you want to celebrate CC's tenth anniversary in your city? Host your own #cc10 event! Even if it's just a happy hour after work, we'd love to hear about it and help you spread the word. Send us an email at <a href="mailto:press@creativecommons.org">press@creativecommons.org</a> and let us know what you're planning. We'll add it to <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC10">our listing</a> and send you some special CC swag for the party (supplies are limited and we may not be able to ship to every location, but we'll try).</p>
