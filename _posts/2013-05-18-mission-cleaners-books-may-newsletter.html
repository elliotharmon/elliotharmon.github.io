<p>It's Friday! If you're in San Francisco and you weren't invited to the big dance, why not <a href="http://www.missioncleaners.com/events/">come see Della Watson and Jessica Wickens at the Canessa Park Reading Series</a> in San Francisco? They'll be joined by fellow Bay Area poet Valerie Witte. The fun starts at 7:30.</p>
<p>If you've never seen Jessica and Della read, then you're missing out. When they read together, they bring amazing poetry as well as crazy surprises like overhead projectors and Polaroid cameras. It's like if you combined the heart of the Frogtown Hollow Jubilee Jug Band with the showmanship of the Riverbottom Nightmare Band.</p>
<p>Of course Jessica and Della will be selling copies of their new book, <a href="http://everythingreusedinthesea.missioncleaners.com/"><em>Everything Reused in the Sea: The Crow and Benjamin Letters</em></a>, which is <a href="http://www.missioncleaners.com/">available right now at Mission Cleaners Books</a>.</p>
<p>Logan Ryan Smith's <a href="http://bughouse.missioncleaners.com/"><em>Bug House</em></a> is still available too. And since you liked the Emett Otter reference, I'll give you free shipping if you <a href="http://www.missioncleaners.com">order both books now</a>.</p>
<p>If you'd like to know when and where Mission Cleaners Books authors will be reading next, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/missioncleaners/">book us on Facebook</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/missioncleaners">itter us on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>By the way, I'm doing a little <a href="http://www.firstgiving.com/fundraiser/elliot-harmon-1/poetry">fundraising drive</a> for the Mend a Heart Foundation. Donate $20 and I'll cowrite a poem with you. It might be fun?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />Elliot</p>
