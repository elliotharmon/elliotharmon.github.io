<p>Creative Commons communities in the Arab world are planning to host the fourth CC Arab regional meeting #4 in Cairo (Egypt) from December 11 to 15, in cooperation with the <a href="http://arabdigitalexpression.org">Arab Digital Expression Foundation (ADEF)</a>.</p>

<p>This has been an exciting year from the CC Arab regional communities, with more and more countries joining our collaborative projects, meet-ups, and local and regional gatherings like the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/33815">CC Iftar</a>.</p>

<p>The fourth regional meeting will be an opportunity to gather CC Arab world communities and have people working together on collaborative projects, workshops, and peer-produced ideas.</p>

<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/28409">Following a formula adopted last year in Tunis</a>, we will be hosting a set of workshops that are designed and produced by the regional community itself. In order to have better teamwork, workshops can accommodate only a limited amount of participants.</p>

<p>If you speak Arabic and you are based in the Arab region, and if you have an interest in openness, sharing culture and cooperation, please have a look at the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/cc-arab-world/xkaJ0uWRL_Q">call for proposals</a>.</p>

<p>We are looking forward to hearing from you!</p>
