<p>The <a href="http://lrmi.net">Learning Resource Metadata Initiative</a> (LRMI) specification has been accepted and published as a part of <a href="http://schema.org">Schema.org</a>, the collaboration between major search engines Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Yandex. This marks the culmination of a year&#8217;s worth of open collaboration with the LRMI Technical Working Group and the wider education publishing community.</p>

<p>This is wonderful news as the LRMI specification will be a peice of the future of education, especially as it pertains to Open Educational Resources (OER). Some of the features of LRMI will allow next generation learning systems based on personalized guided learning. To get a better idea of what kinds of things are possible with LRMI, watch this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKcZ8ozCah0">OSCON keynote by Danny Hillis</a> describing the concept of a Learning Map.</p>

<p>Creative Commons is currently working with 10 different OER platforms and repositories to implment LRMI support and we hope to announce the first few complete implementations by the beginning of next year.</p>

<p>To join the ongoing discussions around LRMI support and implementation, please join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/lrmi">public mailing list</a>.</p>
