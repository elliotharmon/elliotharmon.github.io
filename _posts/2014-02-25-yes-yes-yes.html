<p>Only a few months ago, Creative Commons was ready to start a new adventure. Putting fingers to keys, we were <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/4.0">setting out to draft the new Version 4.0 licenses</a>. With lofty goals like full internationalization and appropriate handling of the <em>sui generis</em> database right, Creative Commons had a tall order ahead. But there was plenty of help on hand. A US attorney gave Creative Commons, free of charge, initial research he had already done on <em>sui generis</em> database rights implementation across Europe. A law firm in Germany volunteered to answer specific questions about the intricacies of these rights based on their experience with implementations. Most importantly, dozens of CC community members around the globe provided input on relevant laws in their own jurisdictions and how the new licenses might be interpreted and applied by their courts.</p>

<p>This is only one example of how Creative Commons benefits from the hundreds of attorneys around the world who give generously of their time and knowledge. <em>Pro Bono Publico</em>, for the public good.</p>

<p>This week is <a href="http://www.probono.net/celebrateprobono/">Pro Bono Week</a> in the United States. It celebrates the long tradition of &#8220;pro bono&#8221; work in the legal profession&#160;&#8212; that is, the provision of legal services to clients for free. While pro bono work is most popular in fields like housing law, domestic violence, and elder abuse, these are by no means the only areas in which people occasionally need some free advice or representation. Over its lifetime, Creative Commons has been very lucky to receive dedicated pro bono representation from some prestigious firms, both in the US and abroad. Assisting in everything from foreign employment and immigration matters to corporate liability, from general legal advice to specific law suits.</p>

<p>In honor of Pro Bono week, Creative Commons would like to extend its gratitude to all the law firms who have provided Creative Commons with pro bono assistance over the years. Because of their help, Creative Commons is able to continue its work to maximize digital creativity, sharing, and innovation. Thank you: Blake, Cassels & Graydon LLP; Cooley Godward LLP; Covington & Burlington LLP; Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton, LLP; Latham & Watkins LLP; Lewis & Llewellyn LLP; Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, LLP; Morrison & Foerster LLP; Ropes & Gray; Samuelson Law, Technology & Public Policy Clinic at UC Berkeley School of Law; WilmerHale (Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP); and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati.</p>

<p>We would also like to thank those lawyers who work with us voluntarily outside the traditional pro bono system. Creative Commons is very fortunate to have the wonderful volunteer assistance of a battalion of legal experts across the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC_Affiliate_Network">CC Affiliate Network</a>, who serve as legal leads, team members, or advisers to our 70+ global CC affiliate teams. These experts provide invaluable input to every aspect of Creative Commons&#8217; work. Programs like license porting and legal tool translations are a direct result of their efforts. They contribute greatly to new license versions, and they keep the organization up to date on legal changes from around the world.</p>

<p>Attempting to list all of these legal community volunteers from around the world would take several pages. Many of them are listed under their respective teams on our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Jurisdiction_Database" title="Jurisdiction Database" target="_blank">Jurisdiction Database</a> page, but even this does not include everyone. To these legal experts who have contributed to Creative Commons becoming the international standard in open content licensing, who have helped make the licenses the best in the field, and who have continued to help CC blaze new paths&#160;&#8212; thank you.</p>

<strong>To all the attorneys and law firms around the world who contribute to Creative Commons with their talents and energy, we send you our most sincere thanks, and we look forward to continuing to work together. Happy Pro Bono Week!</strong>
