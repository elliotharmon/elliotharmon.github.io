2. [Blog post by Ron Silliman](http://ronsilliman.blogspot.com/2008/09/of-19-authors-whose-books-i-read-in.html) about Joe Wenderoth's poem, "Twentieth Century Pleasures".

	There were a lot of interesting comments on this post. They vanished, but [this other guy copied all of the comments onto his own blog](http://joebrainardspyjamas.blogspot.com/2008/09/i-support-joe-wenderoth-buttons.html
).

	[Here's the post I wrote](http://elliotharmon.livejournal.com/84105.html) in kind-of-response.

	Wow, it's blowing my mind that this was all almost three years ago.

3. [Blog post from 2008 by Reginald Shepherd](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2008/02/who-you-callin-post-avant/
) on "Post-Avant".

	I particularly like this bit: "As poet and editor Rebecca Wolff writes of her journal Fence, a home of the post-avant, such writing 'intentionally blurs the distinction between "difficulty" and "accessibility," preferring instead to address a continuum of utterance.'" I like the idea of addressing a continuum of utterance.
The list of established and emerging poets that he identifies as comprising the post-avant movement is interesting too.

4. [Here's Shepherd's blog](http://reginaldshepherd.blogspot.com/), by the way. The man was horribly intelligent.

	And now, Mark Sultan:
