title: Hey guys let's save a city in Chile.
---

<p>Hi friends (it's hard for me to imagine anyone who's not my friend reading this blog),</p><p>Some people I kind of know are, right now, making a big difference in Chile. They're going to the cities hit worst by the earthquake, helping key local NGOs restore Internet connectivity, helping locals let their loved ones know they're okay, and offering basic living supplies. I've written some blog posts about them <a href="http://blog.techsoup.org/node/1190">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.techsoup.org/node/1204">here</a>.</p><p>Here's the thing: they're doing this without much budget, and how many people they can help depends entirely on how much money they can raise. For each $1000 they raise, they can visit one more city. That's not some made-up fundraising number; that's a concrete fact. When they run out of money, they're done.</p><p>I just donated $50. Would you consider donating $50? I think I know at least 19 people who could afford it. If we raised $1000, we'd know that we made a big difference for an actual, real-life city. And that would be pretty cool.</p><p><a href="https://www.globalgiving.org/projects/chile-earthquake-relief/">Consider it.</a> And let me know if you donate, we can keep a tally here.</p><p>Love,<br />Elliot</p>
