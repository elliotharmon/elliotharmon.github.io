<p>Welcome to Mission Cleaners Books&#8217; February newsletter. I&#8217;m excited to announce that our inaugural titles&#160;&#8212; Logan Ryan Smith&#8217;s <a href="http://bughouse.missioncleaners.com/"><em>Bug House</em></a> and Della Watson and Jessica Wickens&#8217; <em><a href="http://everythingreusedinthesea.missioncleaners.com/">Everything Reused in the Sea: The Crow and Benjamin Letters</a></em>&#160;&#8212; are now shipping. If you haven&#8217;t ordered them yet, you&#8217;re in serious danger of losing credibility with the 18 to 34 demographic. And February is Sweeps, guys. Don&#8217;t trust that Golden Globe nomination to carry you.</p>
<p><a href="http://everythingreusedinthesea.missioncleaners.com/"><img src="http://missioncleaners.com/graps/nora-erits-200.jpg" width=200 height=254 align="left" style="padding:5px; " /></a><a href="http://bughouse.missioncleaners.com/"><em>Bug House</em></a> is a book-length narrative poem about animals infesting a man&#8217;s home. Part psychological allegory, part dark comedy, <em>Bug House</em> is hard to put down.</p>
<p>Logan recorded an excerpt of his book over the phone. <a href="http://bughouse.missioncleaners.com/">Listen to it.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://everythingreusedinthesea.missioncleaners.com/"><em>Everything Reused in the Sea</em></a> is a sprawling reimagining of the epistolary novel. Its emails, tweets, footnotes, and linguistic idiosyncrasies all spiral together into a world that continually threatens to tip over, but never quite gets around to it.</p>
<p><a href="http://everythingreusedinthesea.missioncleaners.com/">Watch the book trailer</a>, and then share it with your Aunt Helen and Uncle Ross and the cousins.</p>
<p>If you order both books, you get free shipping. <strong>Click on George Oppen to order</strong>.</p>

<p>Oh, one more thing. Could you <a href="https://www.facebook.com/missioncleaners">like Mission Cleaners Books on Facebook</a>? I need more likes. My UPS guy doesn&#8217;t believe that this is a real thing. He can be so caustic.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />Elliot</p>
