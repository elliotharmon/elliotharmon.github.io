<p>In September, <a href="http://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/eta/ETA20121885.htm">the Obama administration announced $500 million in grants</a> to community colleges around the country for the development of professional training programs under the new Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training initiative (TAA-CCCT), run by the US Department of Labor in coordination with the Department of Education.</p>

<p>For the first time in a federally  of this size, grantees are required to license the training materials they produce under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution licence</a>. <a href="http://www.dol.gov/_sec/media/speeches/20120919_TAACCT.htm">In her speech announcing the grants</a>, Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis stressed that the open-licensing requirement will make it easier for education providers to build on each other's work.</p>

<p>It's striking that this announcement comes within days of California's first-of-its-kind <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/34288">open textbook legislation</a>.
